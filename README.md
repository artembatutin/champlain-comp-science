### What is this?

This is a personal repository created to provide organization and hopefully some collaboration. The title is 'champlain-comp-science', defined as Champlain Computer Science. Champlain in this context is an educational institution located in St-Lambert, Canada. In short, this is an personal educational repository created to provide a better education as I take on six semesters(3 years).

### About me

My name is Artem. I am passionate about technology. I'm currently going to study to become a programmer. I know some Java so I already have a fundamental programming idea on how things are supposed to be in Object-Oriented-Programming. I live in Montreal and I have big dreams on my future career. This is a simple repository for my "start-education" appearance.

### What is the program?

The program is called computer science legacy to mobile. In this program we take a great leap to learn programming from scratch. Please note that this is not a tutorial on how to learn programming. This is simply an personal organization repository. As being said, we will learn to write code in many programming languages. These languages include html, css, javascript, php, java, cobol and perhaps some few others I'm currently not aware of.
