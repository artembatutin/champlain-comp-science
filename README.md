### What is this?

This is a personal repository created to provide organization and hopefully some collaboration. The title is defined as 'champlain-comp-science', defined as Champlain Computer Science. Champlain in this context is an educational institution located in St-Lambert, Canada. In short, this is an personal educational repository created to provide a better education as I take on six semesters(3 years).

### What is the program?

The program is called computer science legacy to mobile. In this program we take a great leap to learn programming from scratch. Please note that this is not a tutorial on how to learn programming. This is simply an personal organization repository. As being said, we will learn to write code in many programming languages. These languages include html, css, javascript, php, java, cobol and perhaps some few others I'm currently not aware of.
