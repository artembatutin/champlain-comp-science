		<h1>What is a Planetarium?</h1>
		<p>A planetarium is a building with a domed ceiling that uses special projection equipment to reproduce images of the night sky. <img src="./Galaxy.gif" alt="Logo" style="float:right" /> A 			planetarium offers the visitor a theatre-like experience in that the room itself is dark, and the "show" is narrated usually by a famous actor or actress. Each season, the planetarium offers 			different shows based upon the night sky of that particular season.</p>

		<!--<img src="./Galaxy.gif" alt="Logo" style="float:right" />-->

		<p>Shows run for a period of about three months and are not repeated after that. If you've been to the planetarium more than three months ago, there's a new, never-been-seen show waiting for 			you. Of course, there's no harm in seeing the same show more than once, as many people do. Most shows are about 42 minutes long, which allows time for exit and entry between shows. Shows start 			on the hour every hour the planetarium is open. The planetarium is not only a place to enjoy a show about the stars, but it's also a place to experience what the stars are about. A visit to the 			planetarium is interesting, educational, and fun.</p>

		<h2>Group Rates and Admission</h2>
		<p>Regular admission is $10 for adults and $7 for children under 12. There are discounted admission plans for public and private schools and colleges. Discounted admission is for groups of 20 		or more for shows Monday through Thursday. Reservations must be made at least 60 days in advance. Group rates do not apply on weekends. In addition, there are some dates when group rates do not 			apply, such as all Federal and State holidays. There is separate admission charge for both the IMAX theatre, and for the StarTours virtual reality ride. Admission to those events is discounted 			for students only and only for shows during the hours of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. You must be 12 or older to take the StarTours virtual reality ride.</p>

		<h2>Chaperone Policy</h2>

Chaperones must accompany students at 			all times. We have separate bathroom facilities for school groups. We also have separate dining facilities for school groups. Educators may visit the planetarium Monday through Thursday and 			speak with a planning representative, who will give you detailed information about how to plan your trip to the planetarium. There is no admission charge or fees of any kind for these planning 			visits.</p>
